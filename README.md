## ## React weather app ##


i used https://mui.com/material-ui/ to skip the css / html part, cause the main focus was to practise react.

to fetch the current and forecast weather data i used: https://www.weatherapi.com, they are offering a free tier for
their api.

I tried to add a webcam livestream to each city but couldnt find any api which offers this, so i added a few YT Livestreams.

https://api.windy.com offers static images of webcams (to check the weather condition on the specific city)
